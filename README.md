## Validation algorithm of energy production data

**Stack:** Python (for being the predominant language in DataScience, but any other language will do as well)

**Helpful experiences:** DataSciences, Time-Series analysis, model training

**Abstract:** Validation of energy production data is an important topic in energy access. There is a lot of work or validation algorithms happening on different platforms, for example, Prospect, Odyssey, or D-REC.

Goal of this challenge is to develop, document and publish a reliable and reusable model to predict the validity of user provided energy production data.
A2EI will provide a training and test dataset. Participants will train their model on the test data set and publish validation results, like AUC etc..

**Expected outcome:** Presentation of the models performance statistics and documentation about the core features of the model.
